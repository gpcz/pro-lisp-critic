* PRO-LISP-CRITIC - A Lisp code critiquing package designed for professional use.

This is an ongoing project to develop Lisp Critic with features that
make it more usable in a professional setting.

Planned features (not yet implemented):
- Ability to record deviations from rules
- A "suggester" for new rules based on redundant code (already a function)

The original readme is available in oldREADME.org.
